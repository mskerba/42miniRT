**miniRT - Ray Tracing Project**

---

*Summary:*
Embarked on a captivating journey into the realm of computer graphics with the development of "miniRT," my first Ray Tracer utilizing the miniLibX library. This project served as an introduction to the intricate world of Ray Tracing, a rendering technique renowned for its ability to achieve unparalleled visual realism. While computationally expensive compared to rasterization, Ray Tracing offers a unique perspective in generating computer-generated images.

*Key Achievements:*
- Implemented fundamental mathematical and physics formulas essential for Ray Tracing without the need for advanced mathematical expertise.
- Developed a functional program capable of generating Computer-Generated Images (CGIs) depicting scenes from different angles and positions.
- Successfully incorporated geometric objects such as planes, spheres, and cylinders into the scene, handling intersections and object transformations.
- Implemented lighting systems, including spot brightness, hard shadows, and ambiance lighting, showcasing mastery in ambient and diffuse lighting concepts.
- Demonstrated proficiency in managing fluid window interactions, resizing objects, and handling resolution changes seamlessly.

*Technical Skills Demonstrated:*
- Proficient in C programming language.
- Applied mathematical principles in geometry, transformations, and lighting calculations.
- Utilized the miniLibX library for graphical rendering.
- Implemented error handling mechanisms for misconfigurations, ensuring a robust and user-friendly application.

*Learning Experience:*
Through the miniRT project, I honed my ability to implement complex mathematical and physics concepts in a practical setting. The project emphasized the importance of meticulous code design, efficient memory management, and error-free execution. This endeavor not only enhanced my programming skills but also provided a solid foundation for future endeavors in the intersection of computer science and mathematics.
